# linear-axis
Low cost linear motor stage for lab use. The axis is based on the Openbuilds C-Beam system. A NEMA-23 stepper motor such as the [Phytron PhyBASIC 56-2 2,2](https://www.phytron.eu/products/motors-actuators/phybasic/) is used to move the axis. A simple controller board receives the positioning commands via USB and drives the motor with up to 2A per phase.
